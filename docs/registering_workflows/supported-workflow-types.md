title: Supported workflow types 
---

It is possible to upload workflows of any type (e.g. bash scripts), either by labelling these workflows as `Other` during registration, or by [proposing a new type](https://workflowhub.eu/workflow_classes/new).

The following workflow types are tested to work well with WorkflowHub:

* [Galaxy (.ga)](glossary.md/#galaxy)
* [Common Workflow Language (.cwl)](glossary.md/#cwl)
* [Nextflow (.nf)](glossary.md#nextflow)
* [SnakeMake (.snake)](glossary.md#snakemake)
* [KNIME (.knwf)](glossary.md#knime)

{% include callout.html type="note" content="Note that it is only possible to automatically generate a diagram for CWL workflows." %}
