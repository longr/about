## Check workflow metadata accuracy and completeness

* Make sure that all the metadata you filled in previously is shown properly and is correct (**Fig 10**). 
* WorkflowHub generates an RO-Crate based on these files and the metadata you filled in while registering the workflow. 
* Click `Download RO-Crate` to check whether the metadata files (`ro-crate-metadata.json` and `ro-crate-preview.html`) are correctly generated.

![check your workflow: Add new files or perform actions (new versions, edits, deletions). Check Description, Creators, Submitter, Tags, Attributions. Inspect files.]({{ '/images/registration-11-check-workflow.png' | relative_url }} "Sections to be checked upon workflow registration completion")
