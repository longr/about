To create a registered workflow entry on WorkflowHub, you need to follow these five steps (links to additional information are provided):

1. [Register](https://workflowhub.eu/signup) and / or [log-in](https://workflowhub.eu/login),
2. Make sure you are a member of a Team ([more info here](/docs/join-create-teams-spaces)),
3. Use the WorkflowHub registration wizard to [import and add a workflow file](/docs/registering_workflows/adding-files),
4. [Add relevant metadata](/docs/registering_workflows/complete-workflow-metadata), and
5. [Review the entry and finalise registration](/docs/registering_workflows/check-uploaded-workflow)
