## What is the overall process for registration?

1. Register and log-in
2. Make sure you are a member of a Team
3. Using the WorkflowHub registration wizard, import and add a workflow file. These files can be:
   - A local file, or files 
   - A remote file URL 
   - A git repository 
   - A zipped [Research Object Crate (RO-Crate)](https://about.workflowhub.eu/Workflow-RO-Crate/)
4. Register the workflow
5. Add relevant metadata
6. Review the entry and finalise registration
