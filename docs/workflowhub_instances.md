description: Brief instructions for making use of the development instance of WorkflowHub for testing and evaluating workflow submissions.

The main WorkflowHub registry for workflows is available here: [https://workflowhub.eu/](https://workflowhub.eu/).

But, did you know that WorkflowHub also operates a development instance? [https://dev.workflowhub.eu/](https://dev.workflowhub.eu/)

You can use this development instance if you want to test WorkflowHub. For example, before contributing to the registry, or as part of testing integration of your systems with WorkflowHub.
