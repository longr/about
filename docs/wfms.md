    <td>Editing a Galaxy workflow
    </td>
    <td>Using the Galaxy workflow editor it is recommended to add tags and/or add for example the tutorial title as Annotation/Notes. More information on how to use the editor can be found <a href="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-101/tutorial.html">here</a> in the "The workflow editor" section.

    <td>Galaxy to CWL abstract
    </td>
    <td>Galaxy workflows can easily be converted to CWL abstract with <a href="https://github.com/workflowhub-eu/galaxy2cwl">galaxy2cwl</a>. This can be seen as a standardized summary of the workflow that can be interpreted by WorkflowHub. CWL abstract can also be used to generate a diagram.

  <tr>
    <td>Uploading to WorkflowHub
    </td>
    <td>Since it is not possible to reference a workflow in a Galaxy instance, you either have to download the workflow file and upload it to WorkflowHub, or make an RO-Crate following the steps below. You can still reference the workflow in the Galaxy instance using the source property in the metadata of the registration.
