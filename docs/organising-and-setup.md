The documentation below will help you to:

1. Get set up on WorkflowHub, and 
2. Provide guidance on the relationship between a given workflow and the structural elements of the WorkflowHub registry: `Spaces`, `Teams` and `Collections`.

Examples are also provided for how to structure larger consortia and projects on WorkflowHub that accommodates recognition of multiple `Organisations` and `Teams`, potentially across multiple `Spaces`.


## Initial set up

To get started with WorkflowHub, you need to follow these 3 steps:

1. [Register with WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/signup),
2. [Log in](https://workflowhub.eu/login), and
3. [Join, or set up, Teams & Spaces](docs/join-create-teams-spaces)

{% include callout.html type="note" content="If you are joining an existing Team on WorkflowHub, you can request to join this Team during the registration process." %}

[More information on Spaces, Teams and Organisations](https://about.workflowhub.eu/docs/space-team-organisation/).


### Example structures that could be used on WorkflowHub

## More complicated structures

Entire consortia, and large collaborative projects, can establish a presence on WorkflowHub. The [complete guide to WorkflowHub](/docs/guide-to-using-workflowhub.md) provides a resource for this purpose, and can be tailored to specific consortia to provide a one-stop guide for contributions to WorkflowHub.
