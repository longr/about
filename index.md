[WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/) is a FAIR **workflow registry** sponsored by the European RI Cluster EOSC-Life,  the European Research Infrastructure ELIXIR and [multiple EU-wide projects](/project/acknowledgements/#funding). It is workflow management system agnostic: workflows may remain in their native repositories in their native forms.

This website describes the open source **project** for developing and running [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/).

## Acknowledgements

We are grateful for contributions from  [**EOSC-Life**](https://www.eosc-life.eu/), [ELIXIR Europe](https://elixir-europe.org/), [**EuroScienceGateway**](http://eurosciencegateway.eu/) and others (see complete [list of funders](/project/acknowledgements#funding)).

## Retention and End-of-Life policy

WorkflowHub's sustainability plan is to ensure the availability of its contributions and metadata up to and beyond 2027. If and when the WorkflowHub reaches its end of service after that, the published contributions and metadata will be archived as RO-Crates and made available through a public repository, such as Zenodo, Figshare or another appropriate resource at that time. [DOI registrations](/docs/citable/) will in this case be updated to link to the archived deposits.
