- title: "CWL abstract"
  description: The CWL abstract is used as a summary of the workflow to parse for example the description (doc) if provided or to generate a svg diagram. If you have a Galaxy workflow you can generate the CWL abstract with <a href="https://github.com/workflowhub-eu/galaxy2cwl">galaxy2cwl</a>. If your main workflow is a CWL workflow, you can skip this step. In the future it will also be possible to convert other workflow types to CWL abstract.
- title: "Diagram"
  description: If your main workflow file is CWL or you give a CWL abstract, the diagram is automatically generated by the WorkflowHub website. In any other case, you will have to supply a diagram yourself, which will then be included in the workflow entry on WorkflowHub (and by extension in the RO-Crate). During registration, you can use the upload / reference fields to attach a diagram in .svg (preferred) or .jpeg/.png format.
